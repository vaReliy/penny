# Metrics Ledger

Append-only ledger of completed tasks, one line per task, written during Phase 6 (Knowledge Capture). This is raw data collection, not a dashboard — no aggregation, no analysis, no pruning. A dedicated measurement-design session happens later, once 20–30 real rows exist.

**Hard constraint:** never `@`-reference this file from `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — that would force-load it into every conversation as noise (same constraint that applies to `docs/KNOWLEDGE_INBOX.md`). Reference it only as a plain path in on-demand indexes.

| Field            | Meaning                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `date`           | ISO date the task completed (`YYYY-MM-DD`)                                                                    |
| `repo`           | Repo name                                                                                                     |
| `task`           | Task file slug or short identifier                                                                            |
| `tier`           | Triage tier at dispatch (`T0`–`T3`)                                                                           |
| `cycles`         | Number of quality-gate restart cycles consumed (0 if it passed first try)                                     |
| `fixnow t/r/s/q` | `## Fix Now` item counts per gate stage, in order: tester / reviewer / security-scanner / qa (e.g. `1/0/0/2`) |
| `emitted`        | Count of pre-existing findings routed to `## Emit as Task` (backlog, not blocking)                            |
| `hardstop`       | `yes`/`no` — whether the 2-cycle hard-stop limit was hit                                                      |
| `model`          | Model tier used for the implementation agent (`deep`/`standard`/`cheap`)                                      |
