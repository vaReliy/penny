# Nx Generator Hygiene

Read this AFTER running any `nx g …` generator (apps, libs, configs) and BEFORE handing
off to the quality gate. Generators produce working-but-unpolished output; every item
below has shipped as a real defect.

## 1. Audit injected dependencies

Generators write caret ranges (`^`) into `package.json` (webpack, webpack-cli, axios, …).
Run the audit + exact-pin procedure in `rules/dependencies.md` before handoff. Short form:
`grep -E '"\^|"~' package.json` must return empty.

## 2. Fix the generated tsconfig

The repo base (`tsconfig.base.json`) is intentionally minimal: no `strict` block,
`"moduleResolution": "bundler"` + `"module": "esnext"`. A generated project does
**NOT** inherit strictness — declare it explicitly in the project's `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  }
}
```

**Module-format contract (applies to every app and lib in this monorepo):**

- `tsconfig.base.json` sets `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` + `"module": "esnext"` for the
  whole workspace. All projects inherit this.
- A webpack-bundled **Nest app** must **not** override `module`/`moduleResolution`. Do
  **not** add `"module": "commonjs"`, `"moduleResolution": "node10"` (or `"node"`/`"node16"`),
  or `"ignoreDeprecations"`. Webpack already emits a CommonJS Node bundle at runtime — the
  TypeScript resolver setting does not change the runtime format.
- **Libs** are ESM (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`) and inherit `bundler`; they are
  consumed from source via tsconfig `paths` and bundled into apps — never published
  standalone, so `nodenext` is not needed.
- `.js` extensions on relative imports are enforced **backend-only** via ESLint (D26/D29).
  Angular/Nx paths use barrel `index.ts` exports and do not need the extension.

## 3. Post-generator corrections by framework

### Vitest Test Target Configuration

The Nx plugin registers the test target as `vite:test` (configured via `testTargetName: "vite:test"` in `nx.json`). Running `pnpm nx test <project>` silently resolves to nothing. Always use `pnpm nx vite:test <project> --skip-nx-cache` for unit test runs in this repo.

### Angular Style Files — SCSS Only

Repo standard: all style files must use SCSS (not CSS). The `@nx/angular:app` and `@nx/angular:lib` generators default to CSS; generated files must be renamed `.css` → `.scss` and all `styleUrl`/`styles` references updated. Also update `apps/*/project.json` `"styles"` array. Pass `--style=scss` to generators to reduce post-gen work.

### Angular Generator Flag Requirements

- `@nx/angular:app` and `@nx/angular:lib` require `--name` flag for the project name (not a positional arg). Correct: `pnpm nx g @nx/angular:app --name=web --directory=apps/web …`. Positional arguments fail with "Schema does not support positional arguments".
- `@nx/angular:component` uses `--path=libs/<lib>/src/lib/<component-folder>/<component-name>` (path to the component file without extension), not `--project`. This changed in Nx v23.

### Angular-Generated vite.config.mts Cleanup

`@nx/angular:app` and `@nx/angular:lib` generators inject `nxViteTsPaths()` and `nxCopyAssetsPlugin()` from `@nx/vite/plugins/…` which are banned by the repo's ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule (removed in Nx v24). These are mandatory post-generator fixes:

1. Remove imports of `@nx/vite/plugins/…`
2. Replace with `resolve: { tsconfigPaths: true }` in the vite config
3. Drop the `nxCopyAssetsPlugin()` call

Also audit the generated stub spec file — it may import the class name without the "Component" suffix (e.g., `GreetingPage` instead of `GreetingPageComponent`). Correct the import before writing test logic.

## 5. Wire process bootstrap (LIVR)

A new process entrypoint (`main.ts`, CLI, queue worker) must call `registerLivrRules()`
from `shared-kernel` **exactly once** at startup, before any `BaseService` or
`LIVR.Validator` runs. `BaseService` does not self-register rules.

**Omitting it passes build and tsc but throws at the first validation call at runtime.**

See `rules/validation-authorization.md` → _LIVR bootstrap_ section for the call site.

## 6. Audit companion projects

Generators scaffold sibling projects (e.g. `apps/<name>-e2e`). Audit them too:

- Remove or narrow any blanket `/* eslint-disable */` the generator added — fix the
  underlying lint issue (e.g. `no-var → const/let`) instead of suppressing the whole file.
- Delete a companion project you don't intend to use rather than leaving it lint-disabled.

## 7. A green build does not close the task

`nx build` exiting 0 proves compilation, not correctness. The quality gate
(`tester` + `reviewer`, see `rules/workflow.md`) still runs. Advance to Phase 4 — do
not declare the task done.
