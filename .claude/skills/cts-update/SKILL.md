# /cts-update

Wraps `.claude/scripts/cts-sync.sh update` ("engine call") and narrates the result. Make exactly ONE engine call; everything else is reading its output plus `git diff`, then summarizing and flagging risks.

## 1. Preflight

- If `.cts-version` is missing, this project was never installed via `cts-sync.sh` — tell the user to run `/cts-setup` instead and stop.
- Print one non-blocking FYI line before the engine call — this is discoverability, not a question, so don't wait for a reply. Default: `Using default source (claude-ts main). Options: --source/--branch to track a fork, --no-merge to skip auto-merge, --no-normalize to skip prettier-based diff normalization.` If `.cts-source` exists and its `source:`/`branch:` lines show a non-default value was used last time, name that source/branch instead of "default" (e.g. `Using last-used source (<source> @ <branch>). Options: ...`).
- The engine itself will print a second FYI line (`Normalizing diffs through this project's prettier (--no-normalize to disable).`) when it auto-detects `./node_modules/.bin/prettier` — this is the engine narrating its own renormalize behavior (comparisons/merges run through the receiver's prettier so formatting-only drift doesn't produce false `locally modified`/`CONFLICT` results); just relay it as part of the captured output in step 3, don't re-announce it yourself.

## 2. Engine call

Run `bash .claude/scripts/cts-sync.sh update`, capturing stderr, and passing through `--source <path-or-url>` and/or `--branch <name>` if the user specified them (e.g. to track a fork or a feature branch). Also pass `--no-merge` if the user says they'd rather skip merge attempts entirely this run (e.g. testing, or they want to keep reviewing every diverged file by hand as before) — otherwise the engine attempts a 3-way merge on any file that changed on both sides.

- Check the call's exit code. A non-zero exit (git clone/fetch failure, missing repo, bad `--source`/`--branch`, etc.) means the sync **did not run** — this is not "already up to date." Stop, show the captured stderr verbatim, and tell the user to retry (most often a transient network issue reaching the source repo). Do not proceed to step 3 in this case, and do not touch `.cts-version` or any files yourself.
- If the exit code is 0, also sanity-check that something actually happened: the script always prints `Done. Review with: git diff` on success. If that line is missing even though the exit code was 0, treat it the same as a failure — surface the raw output and stop.
- **Unconditionally** check the captured stderr for a line starting `Warning: last sync used source ... this run resolved ...` — do this for every successful run, before any narration, not only when the diff already looks alarming. If present, stop here (before step 3) and call `AskUserQuestion` with a single question: header naming the mismatch (`<prev source/branch>` vs `<current source/branch>`), options **"Continue with current source"** and **"Re-run matching prior sync (`--source`/`--branch`)"**. Wait for their choice before proceeding to step 3; if they pick the re-run option, re-invoke step 2 with `--source`/`--branch` set to the prior values.

## 3. Narrate

Only reached after a confirmed successful engine call and, if the mismatch warning fired, after the user has chosen to continue (see step 2).

- Capture the script's stdout: the "Changes:" section (commit log between old and new `.cts-version`), any `ignored, but changed upstream — review manually: <path>` lines, any `merged: <path>` lines, any `CONFLICT: <path>` lines, any `locally modified, not overwritten — diff manually: <path>` lines, any `removed upstream — delete manually if unwanted: <path>` lines, any `appended CTS-required lines (kept your own): <path>` lines, and any `new payload file already exists locally, not overwritten — reconcile manually: <path>` lines.
- Run `git diff --stat` to see which local files actually changed.
- Summarize for the user in five short groups: **Upstream changes** (from the changelog), **Updated locally** (from `git diff --stat`, including `appended CTS-required lines` notices — a payload list-file like `.prettierignore` picked up a new required entry while keeping the project's own), **Merged cleanly** (`merged:` lines — both sides touched the file, non-overlapping hunks combined automatically), **Conflicts** (`CONFLICT:` lines — both sides touched the same hunk, standard `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` markers left in the file), **Needs attention** (changed-upstream-while-ignored + locally-modified-with-no-upstream-change + removed-upstream + new-payload-file-collision notices — the last of these means a path newly added to CTS's payload already existed locally for unrelated reasons and was left untouched; point the user at the printed `diff <(...)` hint to reconcile by hand).
  - **Triage note — contribution round-trip**: if this project previously ran `/cts-contribute`, check the upstream commit message for "from <this-project>" — this project's customizations were merged into claude-ts and are now being synced back down. This is not drift, and it is **not** a uniform "expect a no-op" or "expect a CONFLICT" situation — the signal differs by whether the file is `.ctsignore`'d, because the engine checks `.ctsignore` before the merge path (it never runs a 3-way merge on an ignored file):
    - **Mass "locally modified, not overwritten" notices** (non-ignored files, upstream didn't touch this exact content) — local and upstream may agree even though the baseline changed, producing a diverged-file list that looks concerning but just needs a quick confirm-and-skip.
    - **`CONFLICT:` on a CTS-managed (non-ignored) file** where `/cts-contribute` used "edit before export" on this hunk — genuine conflict, not a merge-engine defect: `cts-contribute` only writes the generalized text into CTS, never back into this project's own copy, so base/local/upstream are three real, different texts. See step 5's guidance: the correct resolution is almost always "take upstream," since upstream now holds this project's own contribution in its generalized form.
    - **`ignored, but changed upstream` on a `.ctsignore`'d file** where `/cts-contribute` used "edit before export" on this hunk — same underlying cause as the CONFLICT case above, but this file can never produce `CONFLICT:` markers because it's ignored before the merge path runs. Triage via step 4's judgment instead: this is usually "local file now matches upstream intent," so removing the `.ctsignore` entry is often the right call.
  - **Fallback note (source mismatch, pre-upgrade engine only)**: step 2 now checks stderr for the source-mismatch warning unconditionally and stops before this step ever runs, so this triage path shouldn't normally trigger. It exists only for output from an older `cts-sync.sh` that predates the warning: if the diff looks like a mass _regression_ — large deletions, several files reported `removed upstream` — right after a run with no `--source`/`--branch` flags, check whether the previous sync used an explicit `--source` (e.g. a local checkout on a different branch) that this run didn't repeat. Verify manually: re-run with the `--source`/`--branch` you suspect was used previously and check whether the resulting `.cts-version` matches the old one exactly — a no-op confirms it was a source mismatch, not real data loss.

The engine only overwrites a payload file outright if the working copy still matches what was synced last time. If it diverged and upstream also changed the same file, it runs a 3-way merge (base = content at the old `.cts-version`) instead of skipping — clean hunks apply silently (`merged:`), overlapping hunks get conflict markers (`CONFLICT:`). If it diverged but upstream did **not** touch that file, or `--no-merge` was passed, it's skipped and reported as `locally modified, not overwritten` rather than silently clobbered.

## 4. Merge upstream changes into ignored files

For each `ignored, but changed upstream` line, run the script's printed `git diff` command yourself and judge the upstream change against the local customized file — this judgment step stays free-text (it's you reading a diff, not the user choosing), but its **outcome** is what gets put to the user as arrow-key options, not typed prose:

- **Improvement that applies here** (new section, fixed instruction, better rule) → candidate for the "hand-merge" bucket below.
- **Local file now matches upstream intent** (e.g. a local fix that CTS has since adopted) → candidate for the "un-ignore" bucket below.
- **Doesn't apply** (upstream change conflicts with why the file was customized) → leave out of both buckets; report it in the summary as "reviewed, no action" and move on — no question needed for these.

If either bucket is non-empty, call `AskUserQuestion` once with up to two questions (skip a question whose bucket is empty):

- **Hand-merge candidates**: `multiSelect: true`, header naming the action (e.g. "Hand-merge upstream changes into these ignored files?"), one option per file (preserving the project's customizations in the merge). Apply only to files the user selects.
- **Un-ignore candidates**: `multiSelect: true`, header e.g. "Remove `.ctsignore` entry — local now matches upstream intent?", one option per file. Remove the entry only for files the user selects.

Respect the 4-option-per-question cap: if a bucket has more than 4 files, split it into multiple grouped questions (page 1, page 2, ...) within the same `AskUserQuestion` call, or across sequential calls if the tool's per-call question count is also limited.

## 5. Resolve conflicts and locally-modified files

Judgment here is spent only on `CONFLICT:` files and `locally modified, not overwritten` files — `merged:` files already applied cleanly and need no review beyond what `git diff --stat` already showed in step 3. As in step 4, reading the diffs/markers stays free-text; the resolution choice goes to the user as arrow-key menus.

**(a) Conflicts.** For each `CONFLICT: <path>` file, open it and read the `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` markers to judge whether taking upstream cleanly resolves every hunk (this is almost always correct when the hunk looks like this project's own wording generalized — see the contribution round-trip triage note in step 3) or whether the file needs a genuine by-hand combination. Then call `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`, header "Take the upstream side for these conflicted files? (unselected → hand-edit together)", one option per conflicted file (page into multiple grouped questions if more than 4). For files selected, replace the file with the upstream side and remove the markers; for files left unselected, walk through their markers hunk-by-hunk with the user to hand-write the resolution. Once every hunk in a file is resolved, tell the user it's ready to stage.

**(b) Locally-modified.** For each `locally modified, not overwritten` line (diverged locally, unchanged upstream — no merge was attempted), run `git -C <src> diff OLD..NEW -- <path>` and judge whether it reads as a push-upstream candidate. Then call `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`, header "Route these locally-modified files to `/cts-contribute`? (unselected → suggest adding to `.ctsignore`)", one option per file (page if more than 4). Point files selected at `/cts-contribute`; suggest a `.ctsignore` entry for the rest, so subsequent updates skip them without re-reporting every run.

Because the engine only merges or skips — it never overwrites a diverged file outright — there's nothing to "revert" for either group; the pre-run content is either still there untouched (`locally modified`) or already merged in place (`merged:`/`CONFLICT:`).

## 6. Close out

By this point steps 4-5 have already resolved everything they found via arrow-key menus — this step never re-asks the same decisions. It only closes the run:

- If nothing was flagged this run at all — no `CONFLICT:`/`ignored, but changed upstream`/`locally modified` lines in step 3's summary — state plainly that the sync was clean and there's nothing to act on. Stop; don't call `AskUserQuestion` for a clean run.
- Otherwise, summarize what steps 4-5 resolved (hand-merged, un-ignored, taken-upstream, hand-edited) and what remains as a **push-upstream candidate** — a locally-modified file the user routed to `/cts-contribute` in step 5(b), still not contributed as of this run.
  - If a push-upstream candidate remains, call `AskUserQuestion` with a single non-`multiSelect` question offering **"Run `/cts-contribute` now"** and **"Stop here, I'll review `git diff` myself"**.
  - If no push-upstream candidate remains, skip the menu and just remind the user of the standing `git diff` reminder below.

Whatever happens, remind them: `git diff` is the merge tool — review and commit themselves. This skill never commits or pushes.
