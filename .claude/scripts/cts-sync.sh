Usage: cts-sync.sh <init|update> [--source <path-or-url>] [--branch <name>] [--dry-run] [--force] [--no-merge] [--no-normalize]

  init    Install the CTS payload into the current project (must be a git repo)
  update  Re-sync the CTS payload, skipping paths listed in .ctsignore

Options:
  --source <path-or-url>  Local checkout dir or git URL (default: claude-ts on GitHub)
  --branch <name>         Branch to track when --source is a URL (default: main)
  --dry-run               Print what would change without copying anything
  --force                 init: overwrite an existing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/.claude/
  --no-merge              update: never 3-way merge — preserve diverged files as-is
  --no-normalize          update: compare/merge raw content, skip prettier renormalize

# crashing under `set -u` once its own locals are out of scope.
# This function's EXIT trap is always cleared with `trap - EXIT` before it
# returns normally; it only ever fires for real if `git show`/`cp` fail and
